## Summary

### What I learned
1. querySelector vs. getElementById
* They both select elements from a web page. They do so in different ways.
* querySelector method lets you retrieve an element using a CSS selector query, you can select elements by ID, class, or any other type of selector. 
* getElementById method retrieves an element by its DOM ID.

You should opt to use the querySelector method if you need to select elements using more complex rules that are easily represented using a CSS selector. If you want to select an element by its ID, using getElementById is a good choice.


### What could be improved
- [ ] How to change 'leaf' to 'earth' on output.
